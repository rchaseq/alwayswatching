# alwayswatching

This is a dynamic styles demonstration. I have created a web page with two eyes that follow your mouse movement exactly. I had to use my skills in HTML, JavaScript and CSS to create this experience. 

# How to Run

Open the page and move your cursor - you'll see! (SEE what I did there?)

# Roadmap of future improvements

* Add facial elements
* Maybe a tongue or something more creepy to also follow the cursor
